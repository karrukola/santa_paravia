## Game description

Santa Paravia en Fiumaccion is a game for one to six players where the object
is to build your tiny Italian state into a kingdom. Scoring is accomplished by
promotion to higher titles of Nobility: Sir, Baron, Count, Marquis, Duke, Grand
Duke, Prince, and King for men, with corresponding titles for women. If anyone
becomes a king or queen, the game is over, and they win. However, life for many
was often fleeting in the Fifteenth Century, so death can end even the most
promising career. If all players die before anyone becomes king or queen, the
first player to reach the highest rant obtained wins. If only one person plays,
the attempt is to be crowned before death.
There are four levels of difficulty: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master and Grand
Master. The difference is that the titles are more difficult to earn. Since life
expectancy is the same (20 to 25 years afterbeginning to rule), the advanced
games are definitely harder. Players alternate turns, with each full turn
representing one year of play. Each turn consists of four phases: 1. Harvelt
Phase 2. Tax Phase 3. Map Phase and 4. Public Works Phase.

### Harvest phase

**Rats** may eat from one to fifty percent of your grain reserves during the
winter.

**Weather** ranges from drought to excellent, and each field in production
produces from one half to four and one half steres of grain per hectare,
depending on the weather. To put 10 hectares of land into production requires
two serfs (not including any working in the woolen mills) and five steres of
grain.

**The Grain Steward** reports the **Harvest** for the year, the grain **Demand** (the
minimum amount to feed your people wihtou some starvation) and the market
pricee of grain and land, which varies with the weather, the ratio of the
Harvest to the Demand, and at random. At this time you may **buy grain**,
**sell grain**, **buy land** or **sell land**. You can buy and sell to make your
state grow and meet it needs, or you may speculate: buying when prices are low
and selling when prices are high. Fortunes have been made (and lost!) by
speculating. After you have made your deals, type ``q`` to continue.

**How much grain will you release for consumption?** the computer will ask.
You must release at least 20 percent of your reserves, and you may not release
more than 80 percent. If you release more than the Demand, most of the time your
population will grow, more or less in proportion ot the surplus. If you release
less, you will have a high death rate as many of your serfs suffer from
malnutrition. Only the serfs are announces, but food distribution affects all
classes of the society, and the growth of your economy as well. Substantial
grain surpluses (35 percent or more) lead to in-migration as serfs come to serve
you instead of more parsimonious lords.

At the end of the Harvest Phase, the computer calculates the changes in your
population during the year, calculates your rents (at 75 Florins per market)
and profits (at a fluctuating rate per mill), and pays your soldiers (3 Florins
per year each). The computer also checks to see if you have enough soldiers to
defend your land. If you have at least one soldier per 500 hectares, you are
safe. If you have less than one soldier per 1000 hectares, you will be invaded.
If you have between one soldier per 500 hectares and one soldier per 1000
hectarees, you are safe unless one of the other players has about 2 and a half
times as many soldiers as you have. An invasion is a real disaster, so keep your
defenses up!

### The tax phase

**CUSTOMS DUTY, SALES TAX,** and **WEALTH** (or income) **TAX** rates are set
by you up to the maximum the computer will accept. The taxes are interrelated,
and raising one may decrease the yield from the others, sometimes by more than
the amount raised. The taxes are based on many different factors, and a good
tax policy at one stage of the game may be a poor one a few moves later. Your
tax rates also affect your economic growth. If taxes are too high, merchants
will move away, trade will collapse, and people will find ways to avoid their
taxes. At the same time, tax money is a prime source for income to build the
economy through public works projects. It is your job to find the right tax
level.

**JUSTICE** ranges from very fair (and that kind of justice costs money but is
marvelous for the economy) to outrageous (the taking of bribes, or selling
justice to the highest bidder). You decide how much justice you need. Sometimes
taking bribes generates much-needed income, especially when there is a famine
and you are broke. But if your instincts tend toward Attila the Hun, you will
notice each year that some of your serfs pack up and run away.

You may change your tax rates as often as you wish, experimenting to get the
best yield. While the computer calculates the yield each time, it does not
credit you with the money until the end ofthis phase.

Borrowing money is possible on any purchase. Your credit is good, as the head
of a state, and the computer will let you spend as much as you want. However,
if there is a negative balance after taxes are collected, the computer (without
informing you) charges you 5O percent interest. After that, if your balance
owed is more than 10,000 Florins times the number of titles you have earned,
you go bankrupt, and that is very bad!

### Map phase

Next the computer draws a map of your kingdom-to-be. The size of the area
enclosed by the **Wall** indicates the amount of land you have. At the upper
left hand corner of the wall is a **Castle**, unless your defenses are woefully
inadequate. You get a large castle if you have at least one soldier per 500
hectares, and a small tower if you have at least one soldier per 1000 hectares.
If you have just a bare wall, you are in trouble.

The mysterious figure on the right hand side of your display is a **horse
pullin a plow**, with a man walking behind. If the horse's head is touching the
top wall, you have enough serfs to farm all your land. (Time to buy more land.)
If the horse is below the wall, you need more serfs. (Try being more generous
with the grain distribution.) You should have your land and serfs balanced for
best production, unless you are speculating in land, in which case you want
unoccupied land for speculation.

**Your woolen mill** is located in the lower right hand corner, if you have one,
and it will grow as you add to it. At the next level up, only touching the left
wall of your kingdom, you will find your **markets**, which also grow as you
add to them. Directly above your markets is the site for your **palace**, which
grows in five increments. If you start to build a palace before giving enough
thought to the amount of land it takes to support a palatial lifestyle, it may
grow right through your wall. Above and to the right of your palace is the site
for your **cathedral**, built in six increments. Any money spent on your palace
and cathedral after the first five or six installments is still just as useful;
altarpieces and thrones cost money, too! The money equips the inside, and makes
your economy and your population grow just as fast.

During the Map phase. check your defenses by examining your fort,  check your
agriculture by the position of the ploughman, and keep your investments balanced
for faster promotions. You might become a Baron on the strength of markets
alone, but you won't go much further.

### Public works phase

You have six options during the public works phase. You may **compare your
statistics** with everyone else. if you have a mind for figures. People with a
mind for figures sometimes do pretty good as rulers! You may purchase weapons
and armor to equip twenty of your husky young serfs as **soldiers**. You may
build a **market** and lure more merchants and more trade to your state. You
may build a **woolen mill** and put one hundred of your serfs to work earning
you hard cash instead of food for rats. This is an excellent approach to an
unemployment problem if your population growns faster than you buy land. If
you are really flush, and ready to move up in the world, you may start (or
continue) to build a **palace** or even a **cathedral**.

At the end of the Public Workss phase. the computer calculates your new title,
if you have earned one. To do this, the computer gives you one point for each
building, for each five nobles, ten clergy, fifty soldiers, fifty merchants,
two thousand serfs, five thousand Florins, six thousand hectares of land, or
each of the economic points that work behind the scenes to build your economy.
The computer divides the sum by six to ten, depending on the skill level of the
game, and subtracts from one to four points for your justice level. This
calculation determines your title, and if you have earned a new one, the
computer changes it.

### Obituary

Right after you give your name to the computer, the year of your death is
selected in a random calculation. Each year the computer checks to see if
"the fullness of time" has arrived. If it has. the computer will print an
obituary, stating the cause of your death, and then display your state map.
After that, the computer will no longer allow your turn, although it will keep
a record of the final statistics of your reign in the comparison table. It is
very possible that another player could live several years longer and not do
as well. It is not age, but highest title reached, which determines the winner.
In the event of a tie, the first person to reach the title wins. This gives a
slight advantage to the first player, but subsequent players make up for it by
being able to cover the most successful person's strategy.

### Strategy

Economic development is vital in the early part of the game. A combination of
outrageous justice and high customs duties generates cash fast. Some of this
money should be channeled into markets or milss to provide cash income and
trigger economic growth. Markets do more for the economy, mills bring in more
income. But the most vital part of early game strategy is buying land. Since
land prices are based on the ratio of your grain harvest to your grain demand,
overpopulation raises the price of land, and that slows your growth. In
addition, if you have surplus land when a famine hits, and the price of land
skyrockets, you may be able to make a financial killing. But don't sell too
much, or the price will never be reasonable. Land prices are high when crops
are good, but also when grain is scarce. Average weather is more likely than
either famine or outstanding crops; the weather is closer to a standard
distribution than to random chance.

End game strategy calls for diversification. Since no factor can contribute more
than ten points to the title routine, you should examine your statistics during
the public works phase and determine the easiest points to get that will still
be useful. In the last couple of turns, sudden high prices for land may make
it worthwhile to sell a lot of land and buy items that contribute points. That
may be enough to give you the crown!
